## Overview

The Push Swap project consists of a set of C programs that implement various operations to sort a stack of integers. The operations include pushing, swapping, rotating, and reversing elements in the stack. The project is designed to be efficient and minimize the number of operations required to sort the stack.

## Installation

To compile the project, you need to have `make` and `gcc` installed on your system. Clone the repository and run the following command:

```sh
make
```

This will compile the source files and generate the

"Go to definition") executable.

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```sh
./push_swap [numbers]
```

For example:

```sh
./push_swap 3 2 5 1 4
```

You can also pass a single string of numbers:

```sh
./push_swap "3 2 5 1 4"
```

## Algorithm

The sorting algorithm used in this project is designed to be efficient and minimize the number of operations. It involves:

1. Parsing and validating the input.
2. Initializing the stacks.
3. Using a combination of push, swap, rotate, and reverse rotate operations to sort the stack.
4. Optimizing the moves to ensure the minimum number of operations.

The algorithm takes into account the size of the stack and uses different strategies for small and large stacks. To dig more into the sorting process an explanation of the functions used in the process can be useful.
